What the project does

LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. Liribot gives you information about a song, artist, or movie that you enter provided that you prompt it with the correct command. 

Below are the commands and what each one will give you:

Concert-this (name of musician)
    >This command will provide you with this information:
        -Name of the venue
       - Venue location

    >This command will provide you with this information:
        -Artist(s)
        -The song's name
        -A preview link of the song from Spotify
        -The album that the song is from
        -If no song is provided then your program will default to "Sign of the times" by Harry Styles

Movie-this (movie name)
    >This command will provide you with this information:
        -Title of the movie.
